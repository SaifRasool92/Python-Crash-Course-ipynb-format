You learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and how\n","to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You saw functions that display\n","output and functions that return values. You learned how to use functions\n","with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. You also saw how to\n","store your functions in separate files called modules, so your program files\n","will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style your\n","functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as easy\n","as possible for you and others to read.\n","\n","One of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that\n","does what you want it to, and functions help you do this. They allow you to\n","write blocks of code and leave them alone once you know they work. When\n","you know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue\n","to work and move on to your next coding task.\n","\n","Functions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as\n","many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function,\n","all you need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job.\n","When you need to modify a function’s behavior, you only have to modify\n","one block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you’ve made a\n","call to that function.\n","\n","Using functions makes your programs easier to read, and good function names summarize what each part of a program does. Reading a series\n","of function calls gives you a much quicker sense of what a program does\n","than reading a long series of code blocks.\n","\n","Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk\n","of your program’s work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a\n","specific job, it’s much easier to test and maintain the code you’ve written.\n","You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether\n","each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do\n","this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time\n","you call them.\n","\n","In Chapter 9 you’ll learn to write classes. Classes combine functions and\n","data into one neat package that can be used in flexible and efficient ways."],"metadata":{"id":"11Eh1JpqhOZm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<br><br>\n","\n","<div align=\"center\" style=\"margin-top:10px;\">\n","  <table style=\"margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;\">\n","    <tr>\n","      <td style=\"padding-right:15px;\">   <!-- small space between image and text -->\n","        <img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170190067?v=4\"\n","             width=\"150\"\n","             alt=\"Saif Ur Rasool\"\n","             style=\"margin-right:15px;\" />\n","      </td>\n","      <td>\n","        <h1><u>Created by Saif Ur Rasool</u> </h1>\n","        <br><b>\n","        <h6><bold>Professional Profiles:</bold></h6>\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/saif-ur-rasool/'>Linkedin</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://github.com/SaifRasool92'>Github</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://leetcode.com/u/Saif_Rasool/'>Leetcode</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://monkeytype.com/profile/Saif_ur_Rasool'>Monkeytype</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://lablab.ai/u/@Saif_123'>Lablab</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://www.behance.net/saifrasool2'>Behance</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <br><br>\n","        <a href='https://www.duolingo.com/profile/SaifUrRasool'>Duolingo</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://linktr.ee/Saif_Ur_Rasool'>Linktree</a>\n","        <br><br>\n","        <h6>Certificates:</h6>\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://digitalcredential.stanford.edu/check/09E8FB28F122CE1CB9A59536C67B8BE8508A5898A71233B6641137391929242FSm9lSGxRQXdrNk0zc215OFdac2Z6aGFTNFhTTC84VkNCbWZVb3NYOXZHQ1liQlVN'>SL @Stanford Code In Place '25</a>\n","        &nbsp;&nbsp;\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://certificates.cs50.io/a9fa79dc-ae41-4317-9925-c7734bf4255d.pdf?size=letter'>Harvard CS50x Puzzle Day Winner '25</a>\n","        <br><br>\n","        <h6>Courses Taught:</h6>\n","        •\n","        <a href='https://github.com/SaifRasool92/5PM_Python-Crash_Course_23th_June'>Python Crash Course</a>\n","      </td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"metadata":{"id":"CNiKJg97Rg2Y"}}]}
