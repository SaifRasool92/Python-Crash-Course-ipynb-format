But when\n","you return to a project after some time away, you’ll likely have forgotten some of the details.

Today, most\n","software is written collaboratively, whether by a group of employees at one\n","company or a group of people working together on an open source project.\n","\n","Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code, so it’s best to start\n","adding descriptive comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise\n","comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as\n","a new programmer.\n","\n","When you’re determining whether to write a comment, ask yourself if\n","you had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable way to make something work; if so, write a comment about your solution. It’s much easier to delete extra comments later on than it is to go back\n","and write comments for a sparsely commented program.
