Now you'll write tests for a **class**. You'll use classes in many of your own programs, so it's helpful to be able to prove that your classes work correctly.

However, there are a few differences, so let's write a class to test. Consider a class that helps administer anonymous surveys:\n","\n","\n","`survey.py`\n","```python\n","class AnonymousSurvey:\n","    \"\"\"Collect anonymous answers to a survey question.\"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, question):  #1\n","        \"\"\"Store a question, and prepare to store responses.\"\"\"\n","        self.question = question\n","        self.responses = []\n","\n","    def show_question(self):  #2\n","        \"\"\"Show the survey question.\"\"\"\n","        print(self.question)\n","\n","    def store_response(self, new_response):  #3\n","        \"\"\"Store a single response to the survey.\"\"\"\n","        self.responses.append(new_response)\n","\n","    def show_results(self):  #4\n","        \"\"\"Show all the responses that have been given.\"\"\"\n","        print(\"Survey Results:\")\n","        for response in self.responses:\n","            print(f\"- {response}\")\n","```\n","\n","This class starts with a survey question that you provide **#1** and includes an empty list to store responses. The class has methods to print the survey question **#2**, add a new response to the response list **#3**, and print all the responses stored in the list **#4**. To create an instance from this class, all you have to provide is a question. Once you have an instance representing a particular survey, you display the survey question with `show_question()`, store a response using `store_response()`, and show results with `show_results()`.\n","\n","To show that the `AnonymousSurvey` class works, let's write a program that uses the class:\n","\n","`language_survey.py`\n","```python\n","from survey import AnonymousSurvey\n","\n","# Define a question, and make a survey.\n","question = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\n","language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)\n","\n","# Show the question, and store responses to the question.\n","language_survey.show_question()\n","print(\"Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\\n\")\n","while True:\n","    response = input(\"Language: \")\n","    if response == 'q':\n","        break\n","    language_survey.store_response(response)\n","\n","# Show the survey results.\n","print(\"\\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!\")\n","language_survey.show_results()\n","```\n","\n","This program defines a question (\"What language did you first learn to speak?\") and creates an `AnonymousSurvey` object with that question. The program calls `show_question()` to display the question and then prompts for responses. Each response entered is received. When all responses have been entered (the user inputs **`q`** or quits), `show_results()` prints the survey results:\n","\n","```\n","What language did you first learn to speak?\n","Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\n","\n","Language: English\n","Language: Spanish\n","Language: English\n","Language: Mandarin\n","Language: q\n","\n","Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey!\n","Survey results:\n","- English\n","- Spanish\n","- English\n","- Mandarin\n","```\n","\n","This class works for a simple anonymous survey, but say we want to improve `AnonymousSurvey` and the module it's in, `survey`. We could allow each user to enter more than one response, we could write a method to list only unique responses and to report how many times each response was given, or we could even write another class to manage non-anonymous surveys.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Z0jFhWyReYBb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Implementing such changes would risk affecting the current behavior of the class `AnonymousSurvey`. For example, it's possible that while trying to allow each user to enter multiple responses, we could accidentally change how single responses are handled. To ensure we don't break existing behavior as we develop this module, we can write tests for the class.\n","\n","## Testing the AnonymousSurvey Class\n","\n","Let's write a test that verifies one aspect of the way `AnonymousSurvey` behaves. We'll write a test to verify that a single response to the survey question is stored properly:\n","\n","`test_survey.py`\n","```python\n","from survey import AnonymousSurvey\n","\n","def test_store_single_response():  #1\n","    \"\"\"Test that a single response is stored properly.\"\"\"\n","    question = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\n","    language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)  #2\n","    language_survey.store_response('English')\n","    assert 'English' in language_survey.responses  #3\n","```\n","\n","We start by importing the class we want to test, `AnonymousSurvey`. The first test function will verify that when we store a response to the survey question, the response will end up in the survey's list of responses. A good descriptive name for this function is `test_store_single_response()` **#1**. If this test fails, we'll know from the function name in the test summary that there was a problem storing a single response to the survey.\n","\n","To test the behavior of a class, we need to make an instance of the class. We create an instance called `language_survey` **#2** with the question \"What language did you first learn to speak?\". We store a single response, **`'English'`**, using the `store_response()` method. Then we verify that the response was stored correctly by asserting that **`'English'`** is in the `language_survey.responses` **#3**.\n","\n","By default, running the command **`pytest`** with no arguments will run all the tests that `pytest` discovers in the current directory. To focus on the tests in one file, pass the name of the test file you want to run. Here we'll run just the one test we wrote for `AnonymousSurvey`:\n","\n","```bash\n","$ pytest test_survey.py\n","============================== test session starts ==============================\n","--snip--\n","test_survey.py .                                                          [100%]\n","\n","============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ==============================\n","```\n","\n","This is a good start, but a survey is useful only if it generates more than one response. Let's verify that three responses can be stored correctly. To do this, we add another method to `testAnonymousSurvey`:\n","\n","```python\n","from survey import AnonymousSurvey\n","\n","def test_store_single_response():\n","    --snip--\n","\n","def test_store_three_responses():\n","    \"\"\"Test that three individual responses are stored properly.\"\"\"\n","    question = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\n","    language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)\n","    responses = ['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin']  #1\n","    for response in responses:\n","        language_survey.store_response(response)\n","\n","    for response in responses:  #2\n","        assert response in language_survey.responses\n","```\n","\n","We call the new function **`test_store_three_responses()`**. We create a survey object just like we did in **`test_store_single_response()`**. We define a list containing three different responses **#1**, and then we call `store_response()` for each of these responses. Once the responses have been stored, we write another loop and assert that each response is now in **`language_survey.responses`** **#2**.\n","\n","When we run the test file again, both tests (for a single response and for three responses) pass:\n","\n","```bash\n","$ pytest test_survey.py\n","============================== test session starts ==============================\n","--snip--\n","test_survey.py ..                                                         [100%]\n","\n","============================== 2 passed in 0.01s ==============================\n","```\n","\n","\n","## Using Fixtures\n","\n","In **`test_survey.py`**, we created a new instance of `AnonymousSurvey` in each test function. This is fine in the short example we're working with, but in a real-world project with tens or hundreds of tests, this would be problematic.\n","\n","In testing, a **fixture** helps set up a test environment. Often, this means creating a resource that's used by more than one test. We create a fixture in `pytest` by writing a function with the decorator **`@pytest.fixture`**. A **decorator** is a directive placed just before a function definition; Python applies this directive to the function before it runs, to alter how the function code behaves. Don't worry if this sounds complicated; you can start to use decorators from third-party packages before learning to write them yourself.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","import pytest\n","from survey import AnonymousSurvey\n","\n","@pytest.fixture  #1\n","def language_survey():  #2\n","\"\"\"A survey that will be available to all test functions.\"\"\"`\n","    question = \"What language did you first learn to speak?\"\n","    language_survey = AnonymousSurvey(question)\n","    return language_survey\n","\n","def test_store_single_response(language_survey):  #3\n","    \"\"\"Test that a single response is stored properly.\"\"\"\n","    language_survey.store_response('English')  #4\n","    assert 'English' in language_survey.responses\n","\n","def test_store_three_responses(language_survey):  #5\n","    \"\"\"Test that three individual responses are stored properly.\"\"\"\n","    responses = ['English', 'Spanish', 'Mandarin']\n","    for response in responses:\n","        language_survey.store_response(response)  #6\n","\n","    for response in responses:\n","        assert response in language_survey.responses\n","```\n","\n","We need to import `pytest` now, because we're using a decorator that's defined in `pytest`. We apply the `@pytest.fixture` decorator **#1** to the new function `language_survey()` **#2**. This function builds an `AnonymousSurvey` object and returns the new survey.\n","\n","Notice that the definitions of both test functions have changed **#3** **#5**; each test function now has a parameter called `language_survey`. When a parameter in a test function matches the name of a function with the `@pytest.fixture` decorator, the fixture will be run automatically and the return value will be passed to the test function. In this example, the function `language_survey()` supplies both tests, `test_store_single_response()` and `test_store_three_responses()`, with a `language_survey` instance.\n","\n","There's no new code in either of the test functions, but notice that two lines have been removed from each function **#4** **#6**, the line that defined a question and the line that created an `AnonymousSurvey` object.\n","\n","When we run the test file again, both tests still pass. These tests would be particularly useful when trying to expand `AnonymousSurvey` to handle multiple responses for each person. After modifying the code to accept multiple responses, you could run these tests and make sure you haven't affected the ability to store a single response or a series of individual responses.\n","\n","The structure above will almost certainly look complicated; it contains some of the most abstract code you've seen so far. You don't need to use fixtures right away; it's better to write tests that have a lot of repetitive code than to write no tests at all. Just know that when you've written enough tests that the repetition is getting in the way, there's a well-established way to deal with the repetition. Also, fixtures in simple examples like this one don't really make the code any shorter or simpler to follow. But in projects with many tests, in situations where it takes many lines to build a resource that's used in multiple tests, fixtures can drastically improve your test code.\n","\n","When you want to write a fixture, write a function that generates the resource that's used by multiple test functions. Add the `@pytest.fixture` decorator to the new function, and add the name of this function as a parameter for each test function that uses this resource. Your tests will be shorter and easier to write and maintain from that point forward."],"metadata":{"id":"XdkdnDFge_rp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<div align='center'>\n","==========================================================================================\n","</div>\n","\n","#### **TRY IT YOURSELF**\n","\n","**11-3.

You learned to write test functions that verify specific behaviors your functions and classes should exhibit. You saw how **fixtures** can be used to efficiently create resources that can be used in multiple test functions in a test file.\n","\n","Testing is an important topic that many newer programmers aren't exposed to. You don't have to write tests for all the simple projects you try as a new programmer. But as soon as you start to work on projects that involve significant development effort, you should test the critical behaviors of your functions and classes. You'll be more confident that new work on your project won't break the parts that work, and this will give you the freedom to make improvements to your code. If you accidentally break existing functionality, you'll know right away, so you can still fix the problem easily. Responding to a failed test that you ran is much easier than responding to a bug report from an unhappy user.\n","\n","Other programmers will respect your projects more if you include some initial tests. They'll feel more comfortable experimenting with your code and be more willing to work with you on projects. If you want to contribute to a project that other programmers are working on, you'll be expected to show that your code passes existing tests and you'll usually be expected to write tests for any new behavior you introduce to the project.\n","\n","Play around with tests to become familiar with the process of testing your code.
