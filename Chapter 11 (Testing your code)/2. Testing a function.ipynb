Here's a simple function that takes in a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:\n","\n","**name\\_function.py**\n","\n","```python\n","def get_formatted_name(first, last):\n","    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\n","    full_name = f\"{first} {last}\"\n","    return full_name.title()\n","```\n","\n","The function **`get_formatted_name()`** combines the first and last name with a space in between to complete a full name, and then capitalizes and returns the full name. To test this **`get_formatted_name()`** works, let's make a program that uses this function. The program **`names.py`** lets users enter a first and last name, and see a neatly formatted full name:\n","\n","**names.py**\n","\n","```python\n","from name_function import get_formatted_name\n","\n","print(\"Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\")\n","while True:\n","    first = input(\"\\nPlease give me a first name: \")\n","    if first == 'q':\n","        break\n","    last = input(\"Please give me a last name: \")\n","    if last == 'q':\n","        break\n","    \n","    formatted_name = get_formatted_name(first, last)\n","    print(f\"\\n\\tNeatly formatted name: {formatted_name}.\")\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"M1tuKPz9HdMu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This program imports `get_formatted_name()` from `name_function.py`. The user can enter a series of first and last names and see the formatted full names that are generated:\n","\n","```\n","Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\n","\n","Please give me a first name: janis\n","Please give me a last name: joplin\n","    Neatly formatted name: Janis Joplin.\n","\n","Please give me a first name: bob\n","Please give me a last name: dylan\n","    Neatly formatted name: Bob Dylan.\n","\n","Please give me a first name: q\n","```\n","\n","We can see that the names generated here are correct. But say we want to modify `get_formatted_name()` so it can also handle middle names. As we do so, we want to make sure we don’t break the way the function handles names that have only a first and last name. We could test our code by running `names.py` and entering a name like Janis Joplin every time we modify `get_formatted_name()`, but that would become tedious. Fortunately, `pytest` provides an efficient way to automate the testing of a function’s output. If we automate the testing of `get_formatted_name()`, we can always be confident that the function will work when given the kinds of names we’ve written tests for.\n","\n","\n","### **Unit Tests and Test Cases**\n","\n","There is a wide variety of approaches to testing software. One of the simplest kinds of tests is a **unit test**. A **unit test** verifies that one specific aspect of a function’s behavior is correct.\n","A **test case** is a collection of unit tests that together prove that a function behaves as it’s supposed to, within the full range of situations you expect it to handle.\n","\n","A good test case considers all the possible kinds of input a function could receive and includes tests to represent each of these situations. A test case with **full coverage** includes a full range of unit tests covering all the possible ways you can use a function. Achieving full coverage on a large project can be daunting. It’s often good enough to write tests for your code’s critical behaviors and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see widespread use.\n","\n","### **A Passing Test**\n","\n","With `pytest`, writing your first unit test is pretty straightforward. We’ll write a single test function. The test function will call the function we’re testing, and we’ll make an assertion about the value that’s returned. If our assertion is correct, the test will pass; if the assertion is incorrect, the test will fail.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fmo-gvEJLkOU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### Here’s the first test of the function `get_formatted_name()`:\n","\n","#### `test_name_function.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from name_function import get_formatted_name\n","\n","def test_first_last_name():  #1\n","    \"\"\"Do names like 'Janis Joplin' work?\"\"\"\n","    formatted_name = get_formatted_name('janis', 'joplin')  #2\n","    assert formatted_name == 'Janis Joplin'  #3\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","Before we run the test, let’s take a closer look at this function. The name of a test file is important; it must start with `test_`. When we ask pytest to run the tests we’ve written, it will look for any file that begins with `test_` and run all of the tests it finds in that file.\n","\n","In the test file, we first import the function that we want to test: `get_formatted_name()`. Then we define a test function: in this case, `test_first_last_name()`  **#1**. This is a longer function name than we’ve been using, for a good reason. First, test functions need to start with the word `test`, followed by an underscore. Any function that starts with `test_` will be discovered by pytest, and will be run as part of the testing process.\n","\n","Also, test names should be longer and more descriptive than a typical function name. You’ll never call the function yourself; pytest will find the function and run it for you. Test function names should be long enough that if you see the function name in a test report, you’ll have a good sense of what behavior was being tested.\n","\n","Next, we call the function we’re testing  **#2**. Here we call `get_formatted_name()` with the arguments `'janis'` and `'joplin'`, just like we used when we ran `names.py`. We assign the return value of this function to `formatted_name`.\n","\n","Finally, we make an assertion **#3**. An **assertion** is a claim about a condition. Here we’re claiming that the value of `formatted_name` should be `'Janis Joplin'`.\n","\n","\n","\n","### **Running a Test**\n","\n","If you run the file `test_name_function.py` directly, you won’t get any output because we never called the test function. Instead, we’ll have pytest run the test file for us.\n","\n","To do this, open a terminal window and navigate to the folder that contains the test file. If you’re using VS Code, you can open the folder containing the test file and use the terminal that’s embedded in the editor window. In the terminal window, enter the command `pytest`.

First of all, we see some information about the system the test is running on **#1**. I’m testing this on a macOS system, so you may see some different output here. Most importantly, we can see which versions of Python, pytest, and other packages are being used to run the test.\n","\n","Next, we see the directory where the test is being run from **#2**; in my case, `python_work/chapter_11`. We can see that pytest found one test to run **#3**, and we can see the test file that’s being run **#4**. The single dot after the name of the file tells us that a single test passed, and the 100% makes it clear that all of the tests have been run.

Also, if you see a message that the pytest command was not found, use the command `python -m pytest` instead.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### A Failing Test\n","\n","What does a failing test look like? Let’s modify `get_formatted_name()` so it can handle middle names, but let’s do so in a way that breaks the function for names with just a first and last name, like Janis Joplin.\n","\n","Here’s a new version of `get_formatted_name()` that requires a middle name argument:\n","\n","#### `name_function.py`\n","\n","```python\n","def get_formatted_name(first, middle, last):\n","    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\n","    full_name = f\"{first} {middle} {last}\"\n","    return full_name.title()\n","```\n","\n","This version should work for people with middle names, but when we test it, we see that we’ve broken the function for people with just a first and last name.\n","\n","This time, running `pytest` gives the following output:\n","\n","```\n","$ pytest\n","================== test session starts ==================\n","-- snip --\n","test_name_function.py F     #1                                [100%]\n","================== FAILURES ================== #2\n","__________________ test_first_last_name __________________  #3\n","\n","def test_first_last_name():\n","    \"\"\"Do names like 'Janis Joplin' work?\"\"\"\n","    formatted_name = get_formatted_name('janis', 'joplin')  #4\n",">   TypeError: get_formatted_name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'last'  #5\n","test_name_function.py:5: TypeError\n","============================== short test summary info ==============================\n","FAILED test_name_function.py::test_first_last_name - TypeError:\n","    get_formatted_name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'last'\n","============================== 1 failed in 0.04s ==============================\n","```\n","\n","There's a lot of information here because there's a lot you might need to know when a test fails. The first item of note in the output is a single **F** **#1**, which tells us that one test failed. We then see a section that focuses on **FAILURES** **#2**, because failed tests are usually the most important thing to focus on in a test run. Next, we see that `test_first_last_name()` was the test function that failed **#3**. An angle bracket **#4** indicates the line of code that caused the test to fail. The line on the next line **#5** shows the actual error that caused the failure: a `TypeError` due to a missing required positional argument, `last`. The most important information is repeated in a shorter summary at the end, so when you're running many tests, you can get a quick sense of which tests failed and why.\n","\n","## Responding to a Failed Test\n","\n","What do you do when a test fails? Assuming you're checking the right conditions, a passing test means the function is behaving correctly and a failing test means there's an error in the new code you wrote. So when a test fails, don't change the test; if you do, your tests might pass, but any code that calls your function like the test does will suddenly stop working. Instead, fix the code that's causing the test to fail. Examine the changes you just made to the function, and figure out how those changes broke the desired behavior.\n","\n","In this case, `get_formatted_name()` used to require only two parameters: a first name and a last name. Now it requires a first name, middle name, and last name. The addition of that mandatory middle name parameter broke the original behavior of `get_formatted_name()`. The best option here is to make the middle name optional. Once we do, our test for names like Janis Joplin should pass again, and we should be able to accept middle names as well. Let's modify `get_formatted_name()` so middle names are optional and then run our test case again. If it passes, we'll move on to making sure the function handles middle names properly.\n","\n","To make middle names optional, we move the parameter `middle` to the end of the parameter list in the function definition and give it an empty default value. We also add an `if` test that builds the full name properly, depending on whether a middle name is provided:\n","\n","`name_function.py`\n","```python\n","def get_formatted_name(first, last, middle=''):\n","    \"\"\"Generate a neatly formatted full name.\"\"\"\n","    if middle:\n","        full_name = f\"{first} {middle} {last}\"\n","    else:\n","        full_name = f\"{first} {last}\"\n","    return full_name.title()\n","```\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eWSnRtI8jG6g"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the new version of **`get_formatted_name()`**, the middle name is optional.
