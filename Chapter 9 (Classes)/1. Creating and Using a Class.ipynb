In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.\n","\n","When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object\n","whatever unique traits you desire. You’ll be amazed how well real-world\n","situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.\n","\n","Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with\n","instances of a class. In this chapter you’ll write classes and create instances\n","of those classes. You’ll specify the kind of information that can be stored in\n","instances, and you’ll define actions that can be taken with these instances.\n","You’ll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share code efficiently. You’ll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files.\n","\n","Understanding object-oriented programming will help you see the\n","world as a programmer does. It’ll help you really know your code, not\n","just what’s happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it.\n","Knowing the logic behind classes will train you to think logically so you can\n","write programs that effectively address almost any problem you encounter.\n","\n","Classes also make life easier for you and the other programmers you’ll\n","work with as you take on increasingly complex challenges.

Everything you learned about\n","functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now is\n","the way we’ll call methods. The `__init__()` method at **#2** is a special method\n","that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based\n","on the Dog class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python’s default method\n","names from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two\n","underscores on each side of `__init__()`. If you use just one on each side, the\n","method won’t be called automatically when you use your class, which can\n","result in errors that are difficult to identify.\n","\n","We define the `__init__()` method to have three parameters: `self`, `name`,\n","and `age`. The `self` parameter is required in the method definition, and it\n","must come first before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this method later (to create an instance\n","of Dog), the method call will automatically pass the self argument. Every\n","method call associated with an instance automatically passes self, which is\n","a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to\n","the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of Dog,\n","Python will call the `__init__()` method from the Dog class. We’ll pass `Dog()`\n","a name and an age as arguments; self is passed automatically, so we don’t\n","need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the Dog class,\n","we’ll provide values for only the last two parameters, name and age.\n","\n","The two variables defined each have the prefix `self` at **#3**. Any variable\n","prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we’ll also be\n","able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n","The line `self.name = name` takes the value associated with the parameter name\n","and assigns it to the variable name, which is then attached to the instance\n","being created. The same process happens with `self.age = age`. Variables that\n","are accessible through instances like this are called attributes.\n","\n","The Dog class has two other methods defined: `sit()` and `roll_over()` **#4**.\n","Because these methods don’t need additional information to run, we just\n","define them to have one parameter, `self`. The instances we create later\n","will have access to these methods. In other words, they’ll be able to sit and\n","roll over. For now, `sit()` and `roll_over()` don’t do much. They simply print\n","a message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be\n","extended to realistic situations: if this class were part of an actual computer game, these methods would contain code to make an animated dog\n","sit and roll over.
