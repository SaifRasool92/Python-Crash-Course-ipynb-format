You saw how to modify the attributes of\n","an instance directly and through methods. You learned that inheritance\n","can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you\n","learned to use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep\n","each class simple.\n","\n","You saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need\n","into the files where they’ll be used can keep your projects organized. You\n","started learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example\n","based on the random module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using\n","Python conventions.\n","\n","In Chapter 10 you’ll learn to work with files so you can save the work\n","you’ve done in a program and the work you’ve allowed users to do.
