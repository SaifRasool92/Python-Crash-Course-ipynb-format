Now that you have a basic understanding of how functions and\n","classes work, you can start to use modules like these that other programmers have written. You can use any function or class in the standard library\n","by including a simple import statement at the top of your file. Let’s look\n","at one module, random, which can be useful in modeling many real-world\n","situations.\n","\n","One interesting function from the random module is randint(). This\n","function takes two integer arguments and returns a randomly selected integer between (and including) those numbers.\n","\n","Here’s how to generate a random number between 1 and 6:\n","```\n",">>> from random import randint\n",">>> randint(1, 6)\n","3\n","```\n","Another useful function is choice(). This function takes in a list or tuple\n","and returns a randomly chosen element:\n","```\n",">>> from random import choice\n",">>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n",">>> first_up = choice(players)\n",">>> first_up\n","'florence\n","```\n","The random module shouldn’t be used when building security-related\n","applications, but it’s good enough for many fun and interesting projects.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"00kPios5Eo8y"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Note**\n","*You can also download modules from external sources.

Dice**: Make a class Die with one attribute called sides, which has a default\n","value of 6.

To do this, capitalize the\n","first letter of each word in the name, and don’t use underscores. Instance\n","and module names should be written in lowercase with underscores between\n","words.\n","\n","Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class definition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the class does,\n","and you should follow the same formatting conventions you used for writing\n","docstrings in functions. Each module should also have a docstring describing what the classes in a module can be used for.\n","\n","You can use blank lines to organize code, but don’t use them excessively. Within a class you can use one blank line between methods, and\n","within a module you can use two blank lines to separate classes.\n","\n","If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module\n","that you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module\n","first. Then add a blank line and the import statement for the module you\n","wrote. In programs with multiple import statements, this convention makes\n","it easier to see where the different modules used in the program come from."],"metadata":{"id":"Ha9NY5zQGgVm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Summary**\n","In this chapter you learned how to write your own classes. You learned\n","how to store information in a class using attributes and how to write\n","methods that give your classes the behavior they need. You learned to\n","write `__init__()` methods that create instances from your classes with\n","exactly the attributes you want. You saw how to modify the attributes of\n","an instance directly and through methods. You learned that inheritance\n","can simplify the creation of classes that are related to each other, and you\n","learned to use instances of one class as attributes in another class to keep\n","each class simple.\n","\n","You saw how storing classes in modules and importing classes you need\n","into the files where they’ll be used can keep your projects organized. You\n","started learning about the Python standard library, and you saw an example\n","based on the random module. Finally, you learned to style your classes using\n","Python conventions.\n","\n","In Chapter 10 you’ll learn to work with files so you can save the work\n","you’ve done in a program and the work you’ve allowed users to do.
