For example, in a simple loop\n","like we used in magicians.py, Python initially reads the first line of the loop:\n","```\n","for magician in magicians:\n","```\n","This line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list magicians\n","and associate it with the variable magician. This first value is 'alice'. Python\n","then reads the next line:\n","```\n"," print(magician)\n"," ```\n","Python prints the current value of magician, which is still 'alice'. Because\n","the list contains more values, Python returns to the first line of the loop:\n","```\n","for magician in magicians:\n","```\n","Python retrieves the next name in the list, 'david', and associates that\n","value with the variable magician. Python then executes the line:\n","```\n"," print(magician)\n"," ```\n"," Python prints the current value of magician again, which is now 'david'.\n","Python repeats the entire loop once more with the last value in the list,\n","'carolina'. Because no more values are in the list, Python moves on to the\n","next line in the program. In this case nothing comes after the for loop, so\n","the program simply ends.\n","\n","When you’re using loops for the first time, keep in mind that the set of\n","steps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many items\n","are in the list. If you have a million items in your list, Python repeats these\n","steps a million times—and usually very quickly.\n","\n","Also keep in mind when writing your own for loops that you can choose\n","any name you want for the temporary variable that will be associated with\n","each value in the list. However, it’s helpful to choose a meaningful name\n","that represents a single item from the list. For example, here’s a good way to\n","start a for loop for a list of cats, a list of dogs, and a general list of items:\n","```\n","for cat in cats:\n","for dog in dogs:\n","for item in list_of_items:\n","```\n","These naming conventions can help you follow the action being done\n","on each item within a for loop.
