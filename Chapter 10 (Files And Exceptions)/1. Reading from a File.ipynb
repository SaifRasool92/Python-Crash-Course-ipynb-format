Text files can contain weather data, traffic data, socioeconomic data, literary works, and more. **Reading from a file** is particularly useful in data analysis applications, but it's also applicable in any situation in which you want to analyze or modify information stored in a file. For example, you could write a program that reads in the contents of a text file and rewrites the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it.\n","\n","When you want to work with the information in a text file, the first step is to read the file into memory. You can then work through all of the file's contents at once or work through the contents line by line.\n","\n","### Reading the Contents of a File\n","\n","To begin, we need a file with a few lines of text in it. Let's start with a file that contains $\\pi$ to 30 decimal places with 10 decimal places per line:\n","\n","From `pi_digits.txt`:\n","\n","```\n","3.1415926535\n","8979323846\n","2643383279\n","```\n","\n","To try the following examples yourself, you can enter these lines in an editor and save the file as `pi_digits.txt`, or you can download the file from the book's resources through `https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e`. Save the file in the same directory where you'll store this chapter's programs.\n","\n","Here's a program that opens this file, reads it, and prints the contents of the file to the screen:\n","\n","From `file_reader.py`:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","path = Path('pi_digits.txt') #1\n","contents = path.read_text() #2\n","print(contents)\n","```\n","\n","To work with the contents of a file, we need to tell Python the **path** to the file. A path is the exact location of a file or folder on a system. Python provides a module called **pathlib** that makes it easier to work with files and directories, no matter which operating system you or your program's users are working with. A module that provides specific functionality like this is often called a **library**, hence the name `pathlib`.\n","\n","We start by importing the `Path` class from `pathlib`. There's a lot you can do with a Path object that points to a file. For example, you can check to see that the file exists before working with it, read the file's contents, or write new data to the file. Here, we build a `Path` object representing the file `pi_digits.txt`, which we assign to the variable `path` **#1**. Since this file is saved in the same directory as the `.py` fie we're writing. the filename is all that `Path` needs to access the file"],"metadata":{"id":"dK5NSB1NOy1j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**NOTE**\n","\n","VS Code looks for files in the folder that was most recently opened. If you're using VS Code, start by opening the folder where you're storing this chapter's programs. For example, if you're saving a new program file in a folder called `chapter_10`, press $\\text{CTRL-O}$ ($\\text{\\textsf{98}}- \\text{O}$ on macOS), and open that folder.\n","\n","Once we have a Path object representing `pi_digits.txt`, we use the **`read_text()`** method to read the entire contents of the file **#2**. The contents of the file are returned as a single string, which we assign to the variable `contents`. When we print the value of `contents`, we see the entire contents of the text file:\n","\n","```\n","3.1415926535\n","8979323846\n","2643383279\n","```\n","\n","The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because `read_text()` returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line.\n","\n","We can remove the extra blank line by using **`rstrip()`** on the contents string:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","path = Path('pi_digits.txt')\n","contents = path.read_text()\n","contents = contents.rstrip()\n","print(contents)\n","```\n","\n","Recall from Chapter 2 that Python's `rstrip()` method removes, or strips, any whitespace characters from the right side of a string. Now the output matches the contents of the original file exactly:\n","\n","```\n","3.1415926535\n","8979323846\n","2643383279\n","```\n","\n","We can strip the trailing newline character when we read the contents of the file, by applying the `rstrip()` method immediately after calling `read_text()`:\n","\n","```python\n","contents = path.read_text().rstrip()\n","```\n","\n","This line tells Python to call the `read_text()` method on the file we're working with. Then it applies the `rstrip()` method to the string that `read_text()` returns. The cleaned-up string is then assigned to the variable `contents`. This approach is called **method chaining**, and you'll see it used often in programming."],"metadata":{"id":"orq8ZVDEPK4j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Relative and Absolute File Paths\n","\n","When you pass a simple filename like `pi_digits.txt` to Path, Python looks in the directory where the file that's currently being executed (that is, your `.py` program file) is stored.\n","\n","Sometimes, depending on how you organize your work, the file you want to open won't be in the same directory as your program file. For example, you might store your program files in a folder called **`python_work`**, inside `python_work` you might have another folder called **`text_files`** to distinguish your program files from the text files they're manipulating. Even though your text files in `python_work`, just passing Path the name of a file in `text_files` won't work, because Python will only look in `python_work` and stop there; it won't go on and look in `text_files`. To get Python to open files from a directory other than the one where your program file is stored, you need to provide the correct path.\n","\n","There are two main ways to specify paths in programming. A **relative file path** tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program file is stored. Since `text_files` is inside `python_work`, we need to build a path that starts with the directory `text_files` and ends with the filename. Here's how to build this path:\n","\n","```python\n","path = Path('text_files/filename.txt')\n","```\n","\n","You can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer, regardless of where the program that's being executed is stored. This is called an **absolute file path**. You can use an absolute path if a relative path doesn't work. For instance, if you've put `text_files` in some folder other than `python_work`, then just passing Path the path `'text_files/filename.txt'` won't work because Python will only look for that location inside `python_work`. You'll need to write out an absolute path to clarify where you want Python to look.\n","\n","Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, because they start at your system's root folder.\n","\n","```python\n","path = Path('/home/eric/data_files/text_files/filename.txt')\n","```\n","\n","Using absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your system. For now it's easiest to store files in the same directory as your program files, or in a folder such as `text_files` within the directory that stores your program files.\n","\n","**NOTE**\n","\n","Windows systems use a backslash $(\\backslash)$ instead of a forward slash $(/)$ when displaying file paths, but you should use forward slashes in your code, even on Windows. The `pathlib` library will automatically use the correct representation of the path when it interacts with your system, or any user's system.\n","\n","### Accessing a File's Lines\n","\n","When you're working with a file, you'll often want to examine each line of the file. You might be looking for certain information in the file, or you might want to modify the text in the file in some way. For example, you might want to read through a file of weather data and work with any line that includes the word `sunny` in the description of that day's weather. In a news report, you might look for any line with the tag `headline` and rewrite those lines with a specific kind of formatting.\n","\n","You can use the **`splitlines()`** method to turn a long string into a set of lines, and then use a `for` loop to examine each line from a file, one at a time:\n","\n","From `file_reader.py`:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","path = Path('pi_digits.txt')\n","contents = path.read_text()  #1\n","\n","lines = contents.splitlines()  #2\n","for line in lines:\n","    print(line)\n","```\n","\n","We start out by reading the entire contents of the file, as we did earlier **#1**. If you're planning to work with the individual lines in a file, you don't need to strip any whitespace when reading the file. The `splitlines()` method returns a list of all lines in the file, and we assign this list to the variable `lines` **#2**. We then loop over these lines and print each one:\n","\n","```\n","3.1415926535\n","8979323846\n","2643383279\n","```\n","\n","Since we haven't modified any of the lines, the output matches the original text file exactly.\n","\n","### Working with a File's Contents\n","\n","After you've read the contents of a file into memory, you can do whatever you want with that data, so let's briefly explore the digits of $\\pi$. First, we'll attempt to build a single string containing all the digits in the file with no whitespace in it:\n","\n","From `pi_string.py`:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","path = Path('pi_digits.txt')\n","contents = path.read_text()\n","\n","lines = contents.splitlines()\n","pi_string = ''\n","for line in lines:  #1\n","    pi_string += line\n","\n","print(pi_string)\n","print(len(pi_string))\n","```\n","\n","We start by reading the file and storing each line of digits in a list, just as we did in the previous example. We then create a variable, `pi_string` to hold the digits of $\\pi$. We write a loop that adds each line of digits to `pi_string` **#1**. We print this string, and also show how long the string is:\n","\n","```\n","3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279\n","32\n","```\n","\n","The variable `pi_string` contains the whitespace that was on the left side of the digits in each line, but we can get rid of that by using **`lstrip()`** on each line:\n","\n","\n","\n","```python\n","--snip--\n","for line in lines:\n","    pi_string += line.lstrip()\n","\n","print(pi_string)\n","print(len(pi_string))\n","```\n","\n","Now we have a string containing $\\pi$ to 30 decimal places. The string is 32 characters long because it also includes the leading 3 and a decimal point:\n","\n","```\n","3.141592653589793238462643383279\n","32\n","```\n","\n","**NOTE**\n","\n","When Python reads from a text file, it interprets all text in the file as a **string**. If you read in a number and want to work with that value in a numerical context, you'll have to convert it to an integer using the `int()` function or a float using the `float()` function.\n","\n","### Large Files: One Million Digits\n","\n","So far, we've focused on analyzing a text file that contains only three lines, but the code in these examples would work just as well on much larger files. If we start with a text file that contains $\\pi$ to 1,000,000 decimal places, instead of just 30, we can create a single string containing all these digits. We don't need to change our program at all, except to pass it a different file. We'll also print just the first 50 decimal places, so we don't have to watch a million digits scroll by in the terminal.\n","\n","From `pi_string.py`:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","path = Path('pi_million_digits.txt')\n","contents = path.read_text()\n","\n","lines = contents.splitlines()\n","pi_string = ''\n","for line in lines:\n","    pi_string += line\n","\n","print(f'{pi_string[:52]}...')\n","print(len(pi_string))\n","```\n","\n","The output shows that we do indeed have a string containing $pi$ to 1,000,000 decimal places:\n","\n","```\n","3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510...\n","1000002\n","```\n","\n","Python has no inherent limit to how much data you can work with; you can work with as much data as your system's memory can handle.\n","\n","> **NOTE**\n","> To run this program (and many of the examples that follow), you'll need to download the resources available at `https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e`.\n","\n","### Is Your Birthday Contained in $pi$?\n","\n","I've always been curious to know if my birthday appears anywhere in the digits of $pi$. Let's use the program we just wrote to find out if someone's birthday appears anywhere in the first million digits of $pi$.

Learning Python:** Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what you've learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase `In Python you can...`. Save the file as `learning_python.txt` in the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote two times: print the contents once by reading in the entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list and then looping over each line.\n","\n","**10-2. Learning C:** You can use the `replace()` method to replace any word in a string with a different word. Here's a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> message = \"I really like dogs.\"\n",">>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')\n","'I really like cats.'\n","```\n","\n","Read in each line from the file you just created, **learning\\_python.txt**, and replace the word **Python** with the name of another language, such as **C**. Print each modified line to the screen.\n","\n","**10-3. Simpler Code:** The program **file\\_reader.py** in this section uses a temporary variable, **lines**, to show how **splitlines()** works.
