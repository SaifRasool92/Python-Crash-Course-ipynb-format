You might allow users to store preferences in a game or provide data for a visualization. Whatever the focus of your program is, you'll store the information users provide in data structures such as lists and dictionaries. When users close a program, you'll almost always want to save the information they entered. A simple way to do this involves storing your data using the `json` module.\n","\n","The `json` module allows you to convert simple Python data structures into JSON formatted strings, and then load the data from that file the next time the program runs. You can also use JSON to share data between different Python programs. Even better, the JSON data format is not specific to Python, so you can share data you store in the JSON format with people who work in many other programming languages. It's a useful and portable format, and it's easy to learn.\n","\n","> **NOTE**\n","> The **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format** was originally developed for JavaScript. However, it has since become a common format used by many languages, including Python.\n","\n","### Using `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()`\n","\n","Let's write a short program that stores a set of numbers and another program that reads these numbers back into memory. The first program will use `json.dumps()` to store the set of numbers, and the second program will use `json.loads()`.\n","\n","The `json.dumps()` function takes one argument: a piece of data that should be converted to the JSON format. The function returns a string, which we can then write to a data file:\n","\n","`number_writer.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\n","\n","path = Path('numbers.json')  #1\n","contents = json.dumps(numbers)  #2\n","path.write_text(contents)\n","```\n","\n","We first import the `json` module, and then create a list of numbers to work with. Then we choose a filename in which to store the list of numbers **#1**. It's customary to use the file extension **.json** to indicate that the data in the file is stored in the JSON format. Next, we use the `json.dumps()` **#2** function to generate a string containing the JSON representation of the data we're working with. Once we have this string, we write it to the file using the same `write_text()` method we used earlier.\n","\n","This program has no output, but let's open the file **numbers.json** and look at it. The data is stored in a format that looks just like Python:\n","\n","```\n","[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\n","```\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aznfsgbWcPh0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now we'll write a separate program that uses `json.loads()` to read the list back into memory:\n","\n","`number_reader.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","path = Path('numbers.json')  #1\n","contents = path.read_text()  #2\n","numbers = json.loads(contents)  #3\n","\n","print(numbers)\n","```\n","\n","We make sure to read from the same file we wrote to **#1**. Since the data file is just a text file with specific formatting, we can read it with the `read_text()` method **#2**. We then pass the contents of the file to `json.loads()` **#3**. This function takes in a JSON-formatted string and returns a Python object (in this case, a list), which we assign to `numbers`. Finally, we print the recovered list of numbers and see that it's the same list created in *number\\_writer.py*:\n","\n","```\n","[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\n","```\n","\n","This is a simple way to share data between two programs.\n","\n","### Saving and Reading User-Generated Data\n","\n","Saving data with JSON is useful when you're working with user-generated data, because if you don't store your user's information somehow, you'll lose it when the program stops running. Let's look at an example where we prompt the user for their name the first time they run a program and then remember their name when they run the program again.\n","\n","Let's start by storing the user's name:\n","\n","`remember_me.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","username = input(\"What is your name? \")  #1\n","\n","path = Path('username.json')  #2\n","contents = json.dumps(username)\n","path.write_text(contents)\n","\n","print(f\"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")  #3\n","```\n","\n","We first prompt for a username to store **#1**. Next, we write the data we just collected to a file called **username.json** **#2**. Then we print a message informing the user that we've stored their information **#3**:\n","\n","```\n","What is your name? Eric\n","We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!\n","```\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZITVzFvjctyr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Now let's write a new program that greets a user whose name has already been stored:\n","\n","`greet_user.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","path = Path('username.json')  #1\n","contents = path.read_text()\n","username = json.loads(contents)  #2\n","\n","print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")\n","```\n","\n","We read the contents of the data file **#1** and then use `json.loads()` to assign the recovered data to the variable **username** **#2**. Since we've recovered the username, we can welcome the user back with a personalized greeting:\n","\n","```\n","Welcome back, Eric!\n","```\n","\n","We need to combine these two programs into one file. When someone runs **remember\\_me.py**, we want to retrieve their username from memory, if possible. If not, we'll prompt for a username and store it in **username.json** for next time. We could write a try-except block here to respond appropriately if **username.json** doesn't exist, but instead we'll use a handy method from the `pathlib` module:\n","\n","`remember_me.py`\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","path = Path('username.json')\n","\n","if path.exists():  #1\n","    contents = path.read_text()\n","    username = json.loads(contents)\n","    print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")\n","else:  #2\n","    username = input(\"What is your name? \")\n","    contents = json.dumps(username)\n","    path.write_text(contents)\n","    print(f\"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")\n","```\n","\n","There are many helpful methods you can use with `Path` objects. The `exists()` method returns `True` if a file or folder exists and `False` if it doesn't. Here, we use `path.exists()`  to find out if a username has already been stored **#1**. If **username.json** exists, we load the username and print a personalized greeting to the user.\n","\n","If the file **username.json** doesn't exist **#2**, we prompt for a username and store the value that the user enters. We also print the familiar message that we'll remember them when they come back.\n","\n","Whichever block executes, the result is a username and an appropriate greeting. If this is the first time the program runs, this is the output:\n","\n","```\n","What is your name? Eric\n","We'll remember you when you come back, Eric!\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4awaR8QDdgst"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Otherwise:\n","\n","`Welcome back, Eric\\!`\n","\n","This is the output you see if the program was already run at least once. Even though the data in this section is just a single string, the program would work just as well with any data that can be converted to a JSON-formatted string.\n","\n","## Refactoring\n","\n","Often, you'll come to a point where your code will work, but you'll recognize that you could improve the code by breaking it up into a series of functions that have specific jobs. This process is called **refactoring**. Refactoring makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to extend.\n","\n","We can refactor `remember_me.py` by moving the bulk of its logic into one or more functions. The focus of `remember_me.py` is on greeting the user, so let's move all of our existing code into a function called `greet_user()`:\n","\n","```python\n","remember_me.py\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","def greet_user():\n","    \"\"\"Greet the user by name.\"\"\"  #1\n","    path = Path('username.json')\n","    if path.exists():\n","        contents = path.read_text()\n","        username = json.loads(contents)\n","        print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")\n","    else:\n","        username = input(\"What is your name? \")\n","        contents = json.dumps(username)\n","        path.write_text(contents)\n","        print(f\"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")\n","\n","greet_user()\n","```\n","\n","Because we're using a function now, we rewrite the comments as a docstring that reflects how the program currently works **#1**. This file is a little cleaner, but the function `greet_user()` is doing more than just greeting the user—it's also retrieving a stored username if one exists and prompting for a new username if one doesn't.\n","\n","Let's refactor `greet_user()` so it's not doing so many different tasks. We'll start by moving the code for retrieving a stored username to a separate function:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","def get_stored_username(path):\n","    \"\"\"Get stored username if available.\"\"\"  #1\n","    if path.exists():\n","        contents = path.read_text()\n","        username = json.loads(contents)\n","        return username\n","    else:\n","        return None  #2\n","\n","def greet_user():\n","    \"\"\"Greet the user by name.\"\"\"\n","    path = Path('username.json')\n","    username = get_stored_username(path)\n","    if username:  #3\n","        print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")\n","    else:\n","        username = input(\"What is your name? \")\n","        contents = json.dumps(username)\n","        path.write_text(contents)\n","        print(f\"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")\n","\n","greet_user()\n","```\n","\n","The new function `get_stored_username()` **#1**has a clear purpose, as stated in the docstring. This function **retrieves a stored username and returns the username** if it finds one. If the path that's passed to `get_stored_username()` doesn't exist, the function returns `None` **#2**. This is good practice: a function should either **return the value you're expecting, or it should return `None`**. This allows us to perform a simple test with the return value of the function. We print a welcome back message to the user if the attempt to retrieve a username is successful **#3**, and if it isn't, we prompt for a new username.\n","\n","We should factor one more block of code out of `greet_user()`. If a username doesn't exist, we should move the code that prompts for a new username to a function dedicated to that purpose:\n","\n","```python\n","from pathlib import Path\n","import json\n","\n","def get_stored_username(path):\n","    \"\"\"Get stored username if available.\"\"\"\n","    ---snip---\n","\n","def get_new_username(path):\n","    \"\"\"Prompt for a new username.\"\"\"\n","    username = input(\"What is your name? \")\n","    contents = json.dumps(username)\n","    path.write_text(contents)\n","    return username\n","\n","def greet_user():\n","    \"\"\"Greet the user by name.\"\"\"\n","    path = Path('username.json')\n","    username = get_stored_username(path)\n","    if username:\n","        print(f\"Welcome back, {username}!\")\n","    # Missing 'else' block which would call get_new_username()\n","    else:\n","        username = get_new_username(path)\n","        print(f\"We'll remember you when you come back, {username}!\")\n","\n","greet_user()\n","```\n","\n","Each function in this final version of **`remember_me.py`** has a **single, clear purpose**.\n","\n","  * We call **`greet_user()`**, and that function prints an appropriate message: it either welcomes back an existing user or greets a new user.\n","  * It does this by calling **`get_stored_username()`** **#1**, which is responsible **only** for retrieving a stored username if one exists.\n","  * Finally, if necessary, `greet_user()` calls **`get_new_username()`** **#2**, which is responsible **only** for getting a new username and storing it.\n","\n","This **compartmentalization of work** is an essential part of writing clear code that will be easy to maintain and extend."],"metadata":{"id":"TXPgS13Deq5j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<div align='center'>\n","==========================================================================================\n","</div>\n","\n","#### **TRY IT YOURSELF**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Fb6hqVhDfzvt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### 10-11.
